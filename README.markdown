Platogo Components
==================

The Platogo components are a toolbox for game developers who are working on games for [Platogo](http://www.platogo.com). They take care of tedious tasks like displaying available levels, highscores and more. The components are designed to be easily skinnable to match the looks of your game.

This is intended to be a community project: we hope some of you will pick up our code and enhance the components. We're sure that there's lots of further useful components and additional functionality that we haven't thought of yet. We're excited and can't wait to see what you'll be doing with the code!

Our [article on Platogo](http://www.platogo.com/devcenter/articles/components) describes the available components in more detail. It has nice screenshots and stuff.
